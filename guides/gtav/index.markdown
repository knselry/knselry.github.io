<h2>Grand Theft Auto V guide</h2>
As the game 'GTAV' has come to have two different meanings (Story Mode & Online), this main page guide will not feature a walkthrough for either but rather 
a series of tips that can be used in either game to improve your gameplay.

<h3>1. Brake Boosting</h3>
Brake Boosting is a driving technique where you brake while extending your car's suspension and gain signifigant speed.
<br>A successful brake boost is marked by seeing tire marks on the road (which you typically only see when burning out or going sideways.)
<br>It lets you reach top speed much faster which is incredibly useful as a large majority of tasks in GTAV/O start &/or end with driving from <br>point A to point B.
<br>A brake boost can be performed across several surfaces, including:
- Down a curb
- Over a grassy curb
- Down a hill (downwards slope depends on speed)

The timing of a brake boost is hard to describe but to get a feel for it you can brake for a larger period of time across surfaces you want to brake boost on.
If you see tire marks, you know that you've gotten a brake boost, and with a well timed brake boost, you may see an increase of ~20km/h over half a second.
<br>Applying Franklin's ability if possible can increase the power of brake boosting massively, allowing the player to reach speeds of >250km/h.

<h3>2. First Person Stealth Jogging</h3>
The third person character controller in GTAV is not inclined towards walking in a direction it's not looking in, especially when jogging or sprinting. This can be inconvienent when trying to navigate through tight spaces or take complex paths quickly during combat. However, in GTAV Enhanced and later versions, the game features a first person mode which can be found after the furthest third person camera in the camera selection. The first person controller has nearly instantaneous movement reaction and is able to strafe in all directions immediately. However, when sprinting, you are only able to go directly forward and starting a movement in any other direction will cause you to stagger. My personal preference for first person movement is first person stealth jogging, because:
- It is roughly as fast as jogging
- It does not stagger when starting to move in a direction
- It does not make noise and therefore does not reveal you on the radar in Deathmatches

<h3>3. Mid-drive boosting</h3>
Mid-drive boosting is a driving technique that allows you to accelerate faster on RWD and AWD drivetrain cars. you can perform a burnout (hold accelerate & brake) and if your rear wheels start burning out, your car is RWD or AWD and can mid-drive. To mid-drive, while in 3rd gear (2nd on some cars like the Banshee), briefly release the gas and tap handbrake (as well as brake, in AWD cars). 
If you don't know what a gear is, for the purposes of this guide, one gear is one speed where you can hear the engine rev from some RPM to the limit.
If performed correctly, for ~3 seconds you will hear your engine get rev-limited (artist's recreation: BRRRRRRR-BRR-BRR-BRR-BRR-BRR) and you will accelerate much faster than normal. You can also mid-drive on later gears although your acceleration will stop once you hit 5th gear speed, so it is less beneficial. 

If you're having trouble figuring out when to activate the mid-drive, you can try these things:
1. Mid-drives are less consistent if you activate them during a gearshift.
2. Your car gearshifts up every time the engine cuts for a moment & comes back at a lower RPM, wait for this to happen twice (you start in 1st gear so 2 shifts = 3rd gear) and then perform the mid drive.

<h3>Other</h3>
- You can zoom in on any weapon, not just the sniper (Zooming in on third person is not recommended as the iron sights do not accurately describe your aim)
- Spraying a weapon for an extended period of time reduces accuracy, however tap firing is always 100% accurate
- If, in cover, you hold a movement direction that you can blind fire out of, a crosshair will appear that will be 100% accurate should you aim out of cover and fire there.
