<h2>Grand Theft Auto Online job warping guide </h2>
Job warping is an incredibly useful technique that allows you to teleport to anywhere in Los Santos that you can place a job marker. There are two methods to job warp in GTAO:
<h3>Timeout Method</h3>
This is the first & easier method as it does not require any reaction time, but it takes 30 seconds to complete. It is performed by checking the map in the pause menu, starting a job from its map blip, then confirming the job and immediately bringing up a screen-wide prompt. (For consoles, this can be done by disconnecting your controller. On PC, you can press Alt+F4 to bring up the quit prompt.) Then, you wait until you hear the game kick you into Freemode, signified by the ambient noise cutting out and then footsteps from your character exiting the job. After that, close the screen-wide prompt and you will be in the new location.
<h3>Insta-quit Method</h3>
This is the second method and it is harder but saves ~10s compared to the timeout method. It is performed by starting a job from the ONLINE section of the pause menu, then leaving the job as soon as the game allows. You will see the screen flash several colours (as if you were switching characters), then suddenly cut to black and fade in to your character having been teleported.
