<h2>Grand Theft Auto Online fast money guide </h2>
GTAO is a game where nearly all of the content has a significant GTA$ buyin, likely to get people to buy Shark Cards. However, there is a consistent way to get money that is
- Solo friendly
- Unlocked at rank 1
- Completely free

This is known as the Cluckin Bell Farm Raid. It has a hefty payout of GTA$500k and a 48 minute cooldown between finishing an attempt & starting another attempt. There is a full guide here: [cluckin bell farm raid](/guides/gtav/cbfr)

Another thing to do that is not as easy to access but is still useful: double/triple GTA$ events. At the time of writing a recent event was the 4/20 week where the weed farm biker business was 50% off and had triple sell value. Even though this is not necessarily solo-friendly it's not impossible to just sell in a private session for multi-vehicle sell missions. Double/triple GTA$ events for jobs & series modes are also useful, as you can enjoy playing the game AND get ~GTA$50k per mission.
