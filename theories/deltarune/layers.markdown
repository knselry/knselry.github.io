title: Layers Theory

In <b>deltarune</b>, I believe there are 3 main layers to the story.

The first layer, or layer 1, is the prophecy & dark worlds, 
it's the surface level story of deltarune that we mainly see throughout the chapters. 
It's the layer Ralsei mainly exists on (though he does know of the higher layers) 
and the one that Susie is the most invested in, though being a lightner permits her 
to be part of layer 2 should she choose to do so.

The second layer, layer 2, consists of the knight conspiracy, 
Kris' dilemma with the SOUL, and more. We see more of this 
layer after chapter 2, and it's the layer Kris & Carol are 
most involved in. Kris, being on layer 2, doesn't care that 
they're playing the villain in layer 1 and so is able to be
a double agent & slash Susie and Ralsei with ease, as they do not see it as a "proper" betrayal 
(its just a game why you have to be mad?)
The third layer, layer 3, is what I like to lovingly call "gaster bullshit." 
It exists as a way to neatly fit the program itself existing as well as the 
soul being put into the world into the story. 

Layer 2 is more of the "main" story (though layer 1 is still important either self evidently or as an extension of lsyer 2)
