# Red in UNDERTALE & DELTARUNE
Red appears several times in UNDERTALE & DELTARUNE.
The most prominently we see it is, of course, the player's SOUL in both games. 
It is always colored red with the exception of SOUL modes in battle, which change it to be different colors.
In UNDERTALE, there are two moments when the entire screen flashes red in addition to several sprites that are red. 
The first one a casual player would likely see is Photoshop Flowey's intro, where the background flashes red.

At the end of a genocide run, choosing not to erase will have the background flash red while Chara jumpscares you.

Outside of red screens, red is the color of damage VFX and damage numbers in UNDERTALE battles. 
As well, Asgore destroys the mercy button with a red spear, and Sans bleeds red blood when you kill him. 
As well, Chara's narration relating to the genocide run is often in red text. 
Finally, when ending a soulless pacifist run, Chara's eyes will glow red.
In DELTARUNE, red appears much less significantly. Of course, it's the default color of your SOUL in this game as well, but outside of that, it's never seen until the end of Chapter 1, when Kris' eye glows red while they're brandishing a knife at us. 
The color red appears prominently in the Chapter 4 continuation of sideb, as stabbing Noelle with the ThornRing has a visual effect of glass shattering in red. When you get the empty dialogue box after Susie asks Kris what they were talking with Noelle about in the hospital, the screen is tinted red for the duration of that box. When you imagine Noelle, the only thing shown in the overworld is a single red pixel while Noelle talks. Right when this scene ends, the screen flashes red. Finally, you can see a single red pixel right before the credits roll in chapter 4. It's likely that this red pixel is Noelle's wound from getting stabbed earlier.
