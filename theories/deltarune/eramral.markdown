title: ERAM vs Ralsei
desc: Theory by selry
---
I propose that the character who speaks in proper capitalization in the mantle game (whom I will refer to as ERAM) is the foil to Ralsei.

In terms of how they see dark worlds (or just play), Ralsei sees them as a way to escape from problems in the Light World
(reality).
> We can't do it all. So... if you ever feel like we're not enough...
> Just forget about us and make some real friends, okay?
-Ralsei, when explaining the true nature of Dark Worlds to Susie

However, ERAM sees play as a way to enforce reality, in a sort of natural selection survival of the fittest way.
> There! That's what I wanted to see!
> Flickering red, like pretty little flames...
> Your eyes can't hide it, Kris. Without play...
> The knife grows dull.
-ERAM, after the bossfight in Mantle 3

However, there is an alternate interpretation of the dichotomy between these two on this subject.

The alternate interpretation is that instead of both parties seeing the Light World as reality, Ralsei sees the Light World as
reality while ERAM sees the dark world as reality.


Second, ERAM and Ralsei have differing opinions on the player possessing Kris.
Ralsei constantly tries to distract the player and comfort Kris.
> ...so that's why, okay, Kris?
-Ralsei after the first "Imagine what Susie is doing" sequence in chapter 1

ERAM instead taunts Kris with the player possessing them.
> The same part of you that enjoyed yesterday.
> Knowing you could say it wasn't really you.
-ERAM commenting on the player's actions before the ERAM fight if you did weird route in ch2

As well, Ralsei's design is mostly white and green, while ERAM is black and orange. This idea alone could sprawl into its own theory
connecting characters' color palettes with their views on the Light & Dark worlds, but I'll write about that another time.
