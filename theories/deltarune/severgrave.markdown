<h2>SeverGrave Theory</h2>
My main claim in SeverGrave theory is that the things that happen to 
Kris before Chapter 1 are extremely similar to the things that happen 
to Noelle in the WeirdRoute.<br/>
However, before detailing that, I am going to go through my reasoning
piece-by-piece.

1. Kris knew Dess' bunker code<br/>
It's likely that the narrator of the game describes things chronologically to how they happen,
so in Chapter 4 when Kris rips out the player while they are reading the code in Dess' guitar,
they rip out the player before they themselves have finished reading it. 
<b>This likely means that Kris had already found the code in Dess' guitar (likely before Dess disappeared).</b>
In addition, the TV world created by Kris reacts to you entering 1225 (the code), 
which is further evidence that Kris knew it beforehand.

2. Parallels between the egg man and ERAM<br/>
In deltarune, each chapter has an extremely hidden 'egg room' in the Dark World that contains a tree, but interacting
with the backside of the tree which is not visible to the player reveals that a man is standing behind
the tree, who gives the player the titular egg. In Chapter 3, both versions of Board 2 have an island to the north (the NORTHERN LIGHT)
containing an entrance that leads underground, however the entrance is blocked by a small fern-looking sprite.
However, if you go here in Tenna's version of board 2, Susie specifically says it's a tree.
In the mantle version of the board, Retro Kris has a sword and can destroy this tree.
<b>In other words, both ERAM and the egg man are behind a tree, and they both likely represent the same character.</b>

3. Parallels between the northern light and the bunker<br/>
I mentioned that in the mantle version of board 2, behind the tree was an entrance that led underground.
This clearly represents the bunker. Given that ERAM is primarily seen in this bunker, this likely means
that <b>the egg man has something to do with the bunker. As well, the way you get into the northern light entrance
is with an ice key.</b> It would be reasonable to assume that "the code from December Holiday" 
would be represented as an ice key.

	So far, we've established that<br/>
	a. there is a man blocked by a tree,<br/>
	b. who has something to do with/is in the bunker,<br/>
	c. who was involved when Kris used Dess' code to get into the bunker (as ERAM only appears inside the bunker).

	As well, the game establishes that when Dess disappeared,<br/>
	a. Kris was most likely involved,<br/>
	b. as well as the bunker (it's the biggest Chekov's Gun of all time),<br/>
	c. and by process of elimination of how else the bunker would be involved (no other ways), Dess most likely disappeared into the bunker.<br/>

	We can put these pieces together and say that<br/>
	a. Kris likely used Dess' code to open the bunker,<br/>
	b. at which point the man was inside the bunker,<br/>
	c. possibly taking Dess inside it.<br/>

	Now, let's introduce more clues.

4. The black shard in the 1225 gacha scene<br/>
The 1225 gacha scene describes there being a 'small, black shard.'
In addition to one of the main visual themes of the Knight being complete darkness,
causing the cutscene where the Knight instantly annhilates the Fun Gang will make it
drop the item 'BlackShard.' Given that the gacha scene plays when you enter Dess' code and then
step into a doorframe that has awfully similar vibes to the bunker entrance, we can infer that
<b>what likely happened was Kris entered Dess' code, Dess went/was taken into the bunker, then they "couldn't find their hand"
while trying to pick up a black shard.</b> I say Dess because Kris clearly has both hands and hometown
likely isn't technologically or magically advanced enough to be able to replace hands yet.

5. Kris covered up something with a tree<br/>
In the Chapter 4 egg room, there is an invisible interaction prompt where you can start drawing on a canvas.
When you start drawing, the narrator describes Kris drawing the same picture over and over again, until their canvas is just a 
'monochrome smear.' After that, Kris paints a tree over everything, the only thing to look at in the room.
As well, in the room there's someone who says "Are you here for Art Club? Right, this is where we draw pictures, and don't kill each other!"
Finally, there's a sink, which when interacted with after the canvas, will say 'You ran water over your hands, and dried them. Between your
fingers, a faint grey crease glittered stubbornly. ... You can never wash it all away.'
The majority of the community have inferred that this is actually a kind of therapy that Kris went to, given the sterile nature
of the room itself. <b>What I want to draw your attention</b> to is the line 'You can never wash it all away.'
I believe this means Kris actually tried to draw the man, but felt guilty for trying to reveal him and covered it up with a tree.
This would also imply that the man wasn't literally behind a tree, but that 'covering the man with a tree' is
a method/coping mechanism Kris employs. This is plausible given that the man being behind a tree only usually happens in Kris' dark worlds.
Further evidence for this is one of the other interactions, 'Someone seems to be making a painting of a tree. However, strangely,
it seems that they haven't drawn the bark yet.' Given how the tree covering the man looks, it's very likely that Kris simply
drew that pattern to hide the man's face and later turned it into a tree.

With this evidence, I will make the main claim of this theory:
Kris' backstory with the man very strongly parallels the events of Weirdroute.

Below is my personal interpretation & retelling of what happens in both stories, using information from one story to fill in for the other.
When I want to point out an equivalence between the two stories, I will say<br/>
A. Kris Dreemurr						B. Noelle Holiday,<br/>
which means that Kris is to Kris' backstory what Noelle is to WeirdRoute.

Without further ado,<br/>
Both stories start with the victims being found & subsequently groomed by<br/>
A. the man behind the tree.				B. the Player.

This first series of abuse results in<br/>
A. Dess being forced into the shelter	B. Berdly getting frozen<br/>
with the <br/>
A. Knife by Kris						B. ThornRing by Noelle<br/>
while under the control of<br/>
A. the man.								B. the Player.

After this, both victims convince themselves that their involvement 
in the loss of the second victim (Dess/Berdly) was just a<br/>
A. nightmare.							B. dream.

Both abusers hear this and tell their victims that their involvement 
was real, which plants in them<br/>
A. A voice called ERAM which tries to convince Kris that they like being part of Weird Route and are as evil as the man.<br/>
B. A seed/baby SOUL which will allow the player to literally control Noelle?
